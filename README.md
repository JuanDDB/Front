This is the initial repo where we are adapting the initial colouring repo to a local version in Colombia starting with Bogot√°. The local academic institution leading this initiatiave is La Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas.

Soon avaliable in https://bogota.colouring-cities.org

Forked from Colouring London https://github.com/colouring-cities/colouring-london

# Colouring Bogot√°

How many buildings are there in Bogot√°? What are their characteristics? Where
are they located and how do they contribute to the city? How adaptable are
they? How long will they last, and what are the environmental and
socio-economic implications of demolition?

Colouring Colombia is a web-based citizen social
science project designed to help address these questions by crowdsourcing and
visualising twelve categories of information on Bogot√°‚Äôs buildings.
